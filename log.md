# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: No side coding today, just forked the challenge rep.

**Thoughts** The hype strikes in. I'm one with the force, the force is with me. Starting the challenge. I will code python (deep learning, back-end), java (android), kotlin (android). The next step would be trying to learn some unfamiliar lang js (full stack) and go (back-end).

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Create a project to show the working examples for some RxJava libraries. The first one is about RxBinding by [JakeWarthon](https://github.com/JakeWharton). Worth 4k stars, so this one should be the first one to try. It begins with with the most used one (I think), RxView.

**Toughts** I am being pushed to write more code. Starting with the famous rxjava library but doesn't support the rxjava2 yet (Soon it will be, because there are a lot of change in the source to support rxjava2), The RxBinding. Transforming the view to emit the event like an observable.

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Continue on the first #100daysofcode project. Now this project will support kotlin programming language. Add more RxBinding sample and use another RxJava library, RxLifecycle by [trello](https://github.com/trello). It has already supported the new RxJava2, and I use both in this project to see the sample.

**Toughts** When facing an error like this:

`` Error:Execution failed for task ':app:prepareDebugAndroidTestDependencies'. 
> Dependency Error. See console for details. ``

Exclude 'com.google.code.findbugs' in your androidTestCompile. I can reproduce this error when adding rxlifecycle v1.0

### Day 3: January 6th, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learn one of many powerfull ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) toolkit, [kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) instead of adding more samples in the first project [ReactiveLibrarySample](https://github.com/muhrifqii/ReactiveLibrarySample).

**Toughts** Understanding speech recognition task is relatively hard.

### Day 4: January 7th, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Try to learn some basic of microservices. Not much code written today, mostly reading and minor update on the first project. Also reading the flask documentation.

**Toughts** Web is a new thing to me. I have done a simple play framework project with scala language programming but mostly no time to continue learning web. Why flask? Because it is written with python which is the datascience powerfull language that I am trying to learn too.

### Day 5: January 8th, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Continue writing the first project. Also Writing a story on medium.

**Toughts** I need to challenge my self writting a story after 5 days of coding to improvise my writing skill.
