# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: No side coding today, just forked the challenge rep.

**Thoughts** The hype strikes in. I'm one with the force, the force is with me. Starting the challenge. I will code python (deep learning, back-end), java (android), kotlin (android). The next step would be trying to learn some unfamiliar lang js (full stack) and go (back-end).

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Create a project to show the working examples for some RxJava libraries. The first one is about RxBinding by [JakeWarthon](https://github.com/JakeWharton). Worth 4k stars, so this one should be the first one to try. It begins with with the most used one (I think), RxView.

**Toughts** I am being pushed to write more code. Starting with the famous rxjava library but doesn't support the rxjava2 yet (Soon it will be, because there are a lot of change in the source to support rxjava2), The RxBinding. Transforming the view to emit the event like an observable.

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Continue on the first #100daysofcode project. Now this project will support kotlin programming language. Add more RxBinding sample and use another RxJava library, RxLifecycle by [trello](https://github.com/trello). It has already supported the new RxJava2, and I use both in this project to see the sample.

**Toughts** When facing an error like this:

`` Error:Execution failed for task ':app:prepareDebugAndroidTestDependencies'. 
> Dependency Error. See console for details. ``

Exclude 'com.google.code.findbugs' in your androidTestCompile. I can reproduce this error when adding rxlifecycle v1.0
