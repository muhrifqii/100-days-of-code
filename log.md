# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: No side coding today, just forked the challenge rep.

**Thoughts** The hype strikes in. I'm one with the force, the force is with me. Starting the challenge. I will code python (deep learning, back-end), java (android), kotlin (android). The next step would be trying to learn some unfamiliar lang js (full stack) and go (back-end).
