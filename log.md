# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: No side coding today, just forked the challenge rep.

**Thoughts** The hype strikes in. I'm one with the force, the force is with me. Starting the challenge. I will code python (deep learning, back-end), java (android), kotlin (android). The next step would be trying to learn some unfamiliar lang js (full stack) and go (back-end).

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Create a project to show the working examples for some RxJava libraries. The first one is about RxBinding by [JakeWarthon](https://github.com/JakeWharton). Worth 4k stars, so this one should be the first one to try. It begins with with the most used one (I think), RxView.

**Toughts** I am being pushed to write more code. Starting with the famous rxjava library but doesn't support the rxjava2 yet (Soon it will be, because there are a lot of change in the source to support rxjava2), The RxBinding. Transforming the view to emit the event like an observable.

**Useful resources**
